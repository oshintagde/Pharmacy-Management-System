Pharmacy-Management-System

The Pharmacy Management System is built in
order to replace manual based systems to computerize. Here system is expected to be efficient,
useful and affordable on implementing tasks that are ordered by the pharmacy manager. The
Pharmacy management system illuminates the problems of the current system. This accessibility
of the information will be of great advantage as it will reduce further medical errors associated
with the physicians and the nurses. This system handles all the aspects of the inventory control
function. It allows the pharmacist to receive new batches of drugs, delete obsolete drugs and
modify the current dosage and identification of the drug in the database.
